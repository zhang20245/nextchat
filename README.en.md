NeatChat is a new version based on NextChat with multiple optimizations. NeatChat currently has three branches: main branch, mini branch, and preview branch.

The preview branch is a preview branch of the main branch, which will be merged into the main branch after stabilization. The mini branch is a separate simplified branch (for mini branch, please visit [NeatChat-Mini](https://github.com/tianzhentech/NeatChat-Mini)).

The mission of the main branch is to optimize UI and add new features, eventually evolving independently from NextChat. The mini branch will make minor adjustments and reductions based on NextChat, closely following NextChat's pace. Only particularly important features from the main branch will be passed down to the mini branch. Due to the different purposes of the main and mini branches, there will be two sets of UI.

# Version Description
Starting from `v1.1.12`, a new version numbering scheme will be adopted. All stable releases will only retain three digits, such as the upcoming `v1.1.13` and `v1.1.14`, which will represent the latest version on the main branch. All four-digit versions, such as `v1.1.12.1` and `v1.1.12.2`, will be incremental updates on the preview branch and will be released as `Pre-release`. All incremental updates on the preview branch will still be regularly merged into the next stable release.

This change is made to create a more compatible versioning scheme for multi-platform packaging, eliminating some unnecessary complications.
